    "        \"This is a simple chess game which works with chess san notations which you can get by browsing the net. For starters you can place a human move like e4, or Nf3. This game is also equipped with two chess engines namely dev-zero and stockfish 9 for learning process. There are more two engines available in the code named cdrill and deuterium but are not used in the gui, you can also check that out. The engines will search for the best possible move and then give it to you. The dev-zero engine was created by my creator and is still in beta mode. The stockfish 9 engine was created by Tord Romstad and his team and this engine is one of the best open source engine in the current era. Some times the engine gives the wrong notation and therefore no move has been returned, therefore you must try once more and check your luck. There are seven user friendly buttons and I am pretty sure that there is no need of explanation. A user can use the tool ngrok and play with any other user in the world by just sending the link provided by the ngrok tool. This server was created by the flask platform, so there are no restriction for one on one move and therefore its not so secure till now but still it works. In a two human's game, a user needs to make a human move then wait and click on the receive human move to receive the move from the person playing from the other side of the world. The users must communicate before and discuss who will play black and who will play white correspondingly. For starters you can make a human move by typing e4.\")\n",
